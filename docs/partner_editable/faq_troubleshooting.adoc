*Q:* I encountered a **FAILED** status on the **Assets** Step of the AWS CodePipeline Deployment.

*A:* If deploying in a new AWS Account, the Assets stage of the CodePipeline may fail due to limitations for the number of concurrent file assets to publish. This is a current limitation of AWS CodeBuild. To fix, click the `Retry` button in CodePipeline for the Assets Stage. This will manually continue the Assets Stage to continue building file assets from its most current progress.
