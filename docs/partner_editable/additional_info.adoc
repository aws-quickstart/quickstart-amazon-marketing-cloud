== Building Your First QuickSight Dashboard with Reports from AMC
The following section walks you through how to build a QuickSight dashboard with a report from Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC). With AMC enabling advertisers to query event level data within a privacy friendly environment and Amazon QuickSight offering users a cloud-powered business analytics service to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from their data - you can begin to build out a business intelligence strategy. 

Advertisers can use QuickSight to analyze reports from AMC to identify valuable insights and then scheduling, publishing dashboards to provide marketing insights in one central location. Custom-built dashboards can pull from a series of custom workflows built on a scheduled cadence. 

=== Initial QuickSight Setup
You will need author access to a QuickSight Account to get started with building your first dashboard. If you don't have a QuickSight account already, below are the steps to create one.

1. Launch the **AWS Console** (https://console.aws.amazon.com) in a new browser tab, search for **QuickSight** and launch it.
2. On the **QuickSight** page, click **Sign up for QuickSight** button.
3. Keep the default **Enterprise** edition, scroll down and click the **Continue** button.
4. Enter a **QuickSight account name** & **Notification email address**. Enter your official email as the notification email.
5. Scroll down and click the **Finish** button. (It can take 15-30 Secs to set up the account)
6. Click the **Go to Amazon QuickSight** button. You will now be taken to QuickSight console.

=== Authorize Your QuickSight Connection
To work with Lake Formation and Athena, make sure that you have AWS resource permissions configured in Amazon QuickSight:

* Enable access to Amazon Athena.
* Enable access to the correct buckets in Amazon S3 Usually S3 access is enabled when you enable Athena. However, because you can change S3 permissions outside of that process, it's a good idea to verify them separately

Use the following procedure to make sure that you successfully authorized Amazon QuickSight to use Athena. Permissions to AWS resources apply to all Amazon QuickSight users.

To perform this action, you must be an Amazon QuickSight administrator. To check if you have access, verify that you see the Manage QuickSight option when you open the menu from your profile at upper right.

For more information, review: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/lake-formation.html 

**To authorize Amazon QuickSight to access Athena and Amazon S3:**

1. Choose your profile name (upper right). Choose **Manage QuickSight**, and then choose **Security & permissions**.
2. Under **QuickSight access to AWS services**, choose **Manage**.
3. Find **Athena** in the list. Clear the box by Athena, then select it again to enable Athena. Then choose **Next**.
4. Under **S3 Bucket**, choose the S3 buckets that you want to access from Amazon QuickSight.
5. From the right column, **Write permission for Athena Workgroup**, choose the S3 buckets you could write your Athena results too.
6. Choose **Finish** to confirm your selection or choose **Cancel** to exit without saving.
7. Click **Save**, to update your new settings for Amazon QuickSight access to AWS services or choose **Cancel** to exit without making any changes.

**To authorize Amazon QuickSight through AWS Lake Formation:**

1. Collect the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Amazon QuickSight users and groups that need to access the data in Lake Formation. These users should be Amazon QuickSight authors or administrators.
  a. Use the AWS CLI to find user ARNs or you can construct the ARNs for each user manually.
  b. To construct manually, replace **REGION_NAME**, **ACCOUNT_ID**, and **QUICKSIGHT_USERNAME**: ```arn:aws:quicksight:<REGION_NAME>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:user/default/<QUICKSIGHT_USERNAME>```
  c. To collect user ARNs programmatically, run the following list-users command in your terminal (Linux or Mac) or at your command prompt (Windows): ```aws quicksight list-users --aws-account-id 111122223333 --namespace default --region us-east-1```
2. Next, Sign in to the AWS Console and navigate to AWS Lake Formation as the data lake administrator. A data lake administrator can grant any principal (IAM, QuickSight, or Active Directory) permissions to Data Catalog resources (databases and tables) or data lake locations in Amazon S3.
3. Choose **Databases**.
4. Select the circle next to the database you want to grant access to your QuickSight user.
5. From the **Actions** drop-down menu, choose **Grant**.
6. Select **SAML users and groups** and enter the QuickSight user ARN.
7. Then click into **Named data catalog resources**
8. Under Tables, open the drop-down menu and select All tables or selectively choose individual tables to permission access to. 
9. For **Table permissions**, choose **Select** and **Describe**.
10. Then click **Grant**.
11. Repeat the preceding steps to grant multiple database permissions to your QuickSight user ARN or other users and groups.


=== Query & Visualize Your First AMC Use Case 
In this section, you'll step through how to build and analyze a visualization for the Time to Conversion use case.

#### Overview

Advertisers may typically ask - how long does it takes for our customers to convert after last seeing our ad? This use case will enable you with the dimensions and metrics to answer that question. 

It is important to understand how long it takes customers who see your ad to complete the conversion, and how that impacts the data you see in your conversion report. Sometimes the conversions happen rapidly, within a few minutes and other times, it might take days for your customers to complete the purchase. You can use this information to adjust the duration of your campaign and promotion to maximize sales.

*Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):*

|===
| KPI | Definition 

| Time to Conversion
| The amount of time customers take from last seeing your ad to purchase. The time has been converted to minutes, hours and days from seconds in the query template. You may adjust it based on your use case.

| Purchases
| The number of times any amount of a promoted product or products are included in a purchase event. Purchase events include video rentals and new Subscribe & Save subscriptions. Sum of purchases from users_that_purchased.

| Total Brand Purchases
| The number of times any number of products are included in a single purchase event. Purchase events include Subscribe & Save subscriptions and video rentals. This counts purchases for promoted products as well as products from the same brands as the products tracked in the order. (Total purchases = Purchases + Purchases Brand Halo)
