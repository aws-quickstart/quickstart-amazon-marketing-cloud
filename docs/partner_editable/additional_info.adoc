* Monitor the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1[AWS CloudFormation], link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects?region=us-east-1[AWS CodeBuild] and link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines?region=us-east-1[AWS CodePipeline] in us-east-1 region and should not have any errors or failures. It will take approximate 90 minutes.


* Once finished go to link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home?region=us-east-1[Amazon Athena] link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html[switch the role] on the top right to @-saw-datalake-users-, Ex. - @demoteam-saw-datalake-users-us-east-1. If using the default settings of the module, put the Account Id the same as the AWS Account Id being used. The Role name should be @demoteam-saw-datalake-users-us-east-1. Switch Amazon Athena workgroup to ---workgroup, EX - demoteam-demodl-dev-workgroup.

* Audience Analysis
** This dashboard provides analysis on audience segments targeted by the customer and also details of audience segments that user was a part of but not targeted for purchases of customer products on Amazon.
* Frequency Distribution
** This dashboard provides analysis on performance and delivery by different frequencies/impression exposures to help optimize campaign frequency caps to maximize conversion likelihood for purchases of assigned customer products on Amazon.
* Device Exposure
** This dashboard helps to determine performance metrics (i.e., ROAS, Impressions, Conversions, Clicks) across device types (e.g., TV, Mobile, PC, Tablet) for purchases of assigned customer products on Amazon.
* Geo Analysis
** This dashboard provides analysis on performance data by geographic location (e.g.DMA) for purchases of assigned customer products on Amazon.
* Product Mix Analysis
** This dashboard provides performance data of users exposed to both sponsored products (SP) and display campaigns (DSP) and KPIs surrounding them.
