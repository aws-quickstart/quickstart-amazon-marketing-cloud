== Cleaning Up the Quickstart

Once the solution has been deployed and tested, use the following command to clean up the resources deployed by the AMC QuickStart:

```
$ make delete_all
```

_NOTE:_ Before running this command, look into the `Makefile` and ensure that:

1.  The `delete_repositories` function is passing the correct `-d AMC_QUICKSTART_REPO_NAME` (default: `ddk-amc-quickstart`)

2.  The `delete_bootstrap` function is passing the correct `--stack-name BOOTSTRAP_STACK_NAME` (default: `DdkDevBootstrap`)

This command will go through the following sequence of steps in order to clean up your AWS account environment:
